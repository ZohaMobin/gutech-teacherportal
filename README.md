# Gutech LMS — Teacher Portal

React web app (Create React App) for **teachers**.
Teachers: marks entry, attendance, class timetable and account settings.

> **Keep this file up to date.** If a hosting account, URL, environment variable or branch rule

## Where everything runs

| Part | Host | Address | Account |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Backend API** | **Render** — service `gutech-lms-backend` | https://gutech-lms-backend.onrender.com | **zohamobin@gmail.com** |
| Admin portal | **Vercel** | https://gutech-adminportal-new.vercel.app | **zohamobin@gmail.com** |
| Teacher portal | **Vercel** | https://gutech-teacherportal.vercel.app | **zohamobin@gmail.com** |
| Student portal | **Vercel** | https://gutech-studentportal-ten.vercel.app | **zohamobin@gmail.com** |
| Database | MongoDB Atlas (`Cluster0`), database `GuPortalQA` = live data | used only by the backend | — |

- **This portal (https://gutech-teacherportal.vercel.app)** is hosted on **Vercel**, under the account **zohamobin@gmail.com**.
  Deploys, environment variables and logs are managed there.
- It calls the **Render** backend. (A second, unused copy of the backend exists on Railway; changing
  Railway settings does not affect this portal.)
- Full backend, database and release details are in the backend repo:
  https://github.com/ZohaMobin/Gutech-LMS-Backend

## Configuration

The only setting is the backend address:

| Variable | Live value | Where it is set |
|---|---|---|
| `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` | `https://gutech-lms-backend.onrender.com` | **Vercel → this project → Settings → Environment Variables** |

- It is **baked in when the portal is built**, so after changing it in Vercel you must **redeploy**.
- The `.env` file committed in this repo contains only a `localhost` placeholder and is **not** what
  the live site uses.
- If the browser shows a **CORS error** on login, this portal's address (`https://gutech-teacherportal.vercel.app`, exactly, with
  `https://` and no trailing slash) must be in the backend's `CORS_ORIGINS` variable on Render.

## Branches and releases

| Branch | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `qa` | **What Vercel deploys to real users.** |
| `staging` | Integration branch: work is merged here and tested locally first. |
| `w1/…`, `fix/…`, `chore/…` | One small change each. |

Release: feature branch → `staging` → test locally → merge `staging` into `qa`. To undo a release,
revert the merge on `qa` (`git revert -m 1 <merge commit>`) and push. GitHub Actions runs the tests
and a production build on every push.

## Local development

Requirements: Node 18 or newer (CI runs Node 22).

```bash
npm ci
echo "REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5001" > .env.development.local   # git-ignored
PORT=3002 npm start
```

Run the backend locally against the **staging** database (see the backend README) — never against
live data. Other commands:

```bash
npm test -- --watchAll=false     # unit tests
npm run build                    # production build
```

## Teacher-specific notes

- Teachers **register here** and cannot use the portal until an administrator approves the account
  (*Account Approvals* in the admin portal).
- Password reset by email depends on the backend's email settings; if email is not configured, ask
  an administrator.

## Maintaining this README

Update it whenever the hosting provider or account, the portal's address, the backend address, or
the release rules change. The "Where everything runs" table is the same in all four repos; keep
them consistent.
